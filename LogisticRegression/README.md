### The goal was to comprehend the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) of the Logistic Regression model from this [paper](http://czep.net/stat/mlelr.pdf). However, solving for the MLE of the *beta* coefficients requires solving nonlinear equations. Since nonlinear equations are not easy to solve, the solution must be numerically estimated using an iterative process. As such, the paper recommends that one of the most popular methods to solve a system of nonlinear equations is to use the *Newton's Rahpson Method*. In the file logitR(GradDesc) contains the implementation of the Newton's Rahpson Method. After implementing the algorithm, I benchmarked the results against the in-built glm() function.

### The logitR(In-built) is just a simple script to familiarize with R's in-built glm and prediction funtions.
